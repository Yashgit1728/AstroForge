# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AstraForge is an AI-powered, open-source space mission simulator that democratizes space mission planning by allowing anyone to design, simulate, and optimize space missions through an intuitive web interface. The system combines AI-driven mission ideation with physics-based simulation and interactive 3D visualization to provide users with a comprehensive mission planning experience similar to what NASA mission planners use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a space enthusiast, I want to describe my mission idea in natural language, so that the AI can generate a detailed mission specification with realistic parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a mission prompt THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive mission specification including objectives, timeline, spacecraft configuration, and trajectory
2. WHEN the AI generates a mission specification THEN the system SHALL validate the parameters against physical constraints and feasibility
3. IF the mission parameters are infeasible THEN the system SHALL provide alternative suggestions with explanations
4. WHEN a mission is generated THEN the system SHALL save it to the user's mission gallery

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mission planner, I want to view detailed mission specifications with interactive charts and 3D visualizations, so that I can understand the mission trajectory and key metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a mission detail page THEN the system SHALL display mission specifications, trajectory charts, and 3D visualization
2. WHEN displaying trajectory data THEN the system SHALL show orbital mechanics, delta-v requirements, and timeline milestones
3. WHEN rendering 3D visualization THEN the system SHALL display spacecraft, celestial bodies, and trajectory paths in real-time
4. WHEN a user interacts with the 3D scene THEN the system SHALL allow camera controls and object selection for detailed information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run physics-based simulations of my mission, so that I can validate the feasibility and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a simulation THEN the system SHALL calculate orbital mechanics, fuel consumption, and mission timeline
2. WHEN simulation is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and intermediate results
3. WHEN simulation completes THEN the system SHALL generate performance metrics including success probability, cost estimates, and risk factors
4. IF simulation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mission designer, I want to optimize my mission parameters automatically, so that I can achieve the best performance within constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests optimization THEN the system SHALL use genetic algorithms to explore parameter space
2. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL consider multiple objectives including fuel efficiency, mission duration, and success probability
3. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL present Pareto-optimal solutions with trade-off analysis
4. WHEN a user selects an optimized solution THEN the system SHALL update the mission specification accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse a gallery of example missions and my saved missions, so that I can learn from existing designs and manage my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the gallery THEN the system SHALL display curated example missions and user-created missions
2. WHEN browsing missions THEN the system SHALL show mission thumbnails, key metrics, and difficulty ratings
3. WHEN a user selects a mission THEN the system SHALL allow viewing, cloning, or editing the mission
4. WHEN a user saves a mission THEN the system SHALL store it in their personal gallery with metadata

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate and save my missions, so that I can access my work across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to save missions THEN the system SHALL provide magic link authentication or anonymous sessions
2. WHEN authenticated THEN the system SHALL associate missions with the user account
3. WHEN using anonymous sessions THEN the system SHALL optionally allow email collection for mission recovery
4. WHEN a user returns THEN the system SHALL restore their saved missions and preferences

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be modular and extensible, so that new vehicle types, mission types, and AI providers can be easily added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating AI providers THEN the system SHALL use a switchable abstraction layer supporting Claude, Groq, and OpenAI
2. WHEN adding vehicle types THEN the system SHALL support configurable presets with performance characteristics
3. WHEN extending mission types THEN the system SHALL allow new simulation modules and optimization strategies
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support containerized deployment on multiple cloud platforms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be scalable and maintainable, so that it can handle growing user loads and feature additions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the frontend SHALL be served from a CDN with optimized loading
2. WHEN processing simulations THEN the backend SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
3. WHEN the system scales THEN the database SHALL maintain performance with proper indexing and query optimization
4. WHEN code changes are made THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL automatically test, build, and deploy updates
