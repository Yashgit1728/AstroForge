- **Security**: Secure session tokens, HTTP-only cookies, CORS configuration

### API Design Patterns
- **RESTful Design**: Standard REST patterns with proper HTTP methods
- **Pydantic Validation**: Comprehensive request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- **Filtering**: Advanced filtering with multiple criteria support

### Search Implementation
- **Text Search**: Full-text search across mission names, descriptions, and objectives
- **Relevance Ranking**: Search results ranked by relevance and recency
- **Faceted Search**: Multiple filter dimensions (target body, vehicle type, difficulty)
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: Database integration testing with mocked dependencies
- **Mock Services**: Proper mocking of external services (Supabase, AI providers)
- **Edge Cases**: Testing of error conditions and validation failures

## Integration Points

### AI Services Integration
- Mission generation endpoints integrate with existing AI ideation service
- Support for multiple LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Groq)
- Proper error handling for AI service failures

### Physics Engine Integration
- Simulation endpoints integrate with existing physics simulation service
- Support for background task execution for long-running simulations
- Progress tracking and result storage
